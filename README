Setting up:

* Install perl modules
* Check out git submodule


Perl Dependencies:

JSON::XS
Moose


Non-perl Dependencies:

This tool currently builds KiCad 6.0 projects. That's not strictly necessary. If you need us to back down to 5.1, please say so.


There's a git submodule of 'kicad', which includes the keyboardio kicad footprints. Pull requests over there are welcome.


Usage:

perl layout.pl --usb=c --project=104-key --layout=kle-layouts/104.json 
cd 104-key
kicad 104-key.pro
